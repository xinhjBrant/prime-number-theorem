I. Definitions of Paths
----------------------------------------
A path is a differentiable function :math:`f : \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C}` with a continuous derivative, defined on :math:`\mathbb{R}`, but we only consider their values on [0,1].

Constant Paths
    For example, for any fixed point :math:`z : \mathbb{C}` we have a constant path :math:`\lambda (t : \mathbb{R}), z`.

Inverse of Paths
    The inverse of a path is to reverse the direction of a path.
    
    For example, given a path :math:`L: \mathbb{R}\to \mathbb{C}`, we define the inverse of the path as :math:`\lambda (t:\mathbb{R}), L(1-t)`.
